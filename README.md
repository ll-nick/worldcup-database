# Worldcup Database

A database containing the 2014 and 2018 final-three rounds of the football (soccer in this case) world cup tournament.

The database is filled with data read from the games.csv file using the insert_data.sh script.

Various queries are done in the queries.sh script. The output should match the expected_output.txt.

All this is done to pass the FreeCodeCamp relational database curriculum.
